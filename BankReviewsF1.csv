I highly recommend working with Zach and PNB Housing!",PNB Housing Finance
20-12-2016,5,"I had the pleasure of working with PNB Housing in September 2018 as my family and I were making a home purchase in Columbus, OH. From the original conversation with the loan officer to underwriting and all the way through closing, the entire team from PNB Housingwas very responsive and professional. I was VERY impressed with how smooth their process was and how timely the communication was given how stressful of a process home buying (and selling) can be",PNB Housing Finance

She is a wonderful person!",PNB Housing Finance
16-08-2016,5,Patrick answered all my questions by email immediately and he spent a lot of time making sure I got the right loan for my situation. The portal they use is extremely easy and we closed on the refinance with 2 weeks. Very pleased with the customer service and intend on using Patrick again when we refinance later!!!!,PNB Housing Finance
04-09-2017,5,"I loved working with this group of people! They laughed with me over the phone! Always answered my questions and moved the loan along as quickly as possible! Knowledgeable staff! While we were shopping around for a lender, one lender badmouthed Wyndham, they lost my business because of it. When I told PNB Housingabout it, they had the class not to say anything negative about another company, just to get the ""sell""",PNB Housing Finance
22-03-2016,5,Great web interface for both the loan application and document upload and download features. Quick responses to any questions or concerns. Willingness to communicate almost exclusively via email...as phone calls weren't always an option for us.,PNB Housing Finance
02-04-2017,4,"Working with Michelle and PNB Housingwent really well for me. As a first time homeowner and this being my first refinance, I feel that this process was smooth and successful. I will definitely recommend Michelle to friends and family.",PNB Housing Finance
06-02-2016,4,"usten Butler brought the humanity and connection to what can be a very stiff, lifeless, and scary transaction. Not only that, it is quite possibly the largest purchase my wife and I will ever make. We didn't simply want to transact with a faceless institution. A lot was riding on picking the right house and making sure everything would work out. Austen was there for us, every step of the way. It's true. Austen got us the best deal. Yes, that's also true. But it's more than that. From when we first starting looking to over a year later when we found the home we wanted, his presence, positivity, and guidance gave us the confidence to take the step and move into our dream home. It's made a HUGE difference for our family, we're right where we want to be, have 13 kids on our block, and couldn't be happier - and it's all thanks to Austen Butler's help.",PNB Housing Finance
11-06-2016,4,Jay was easy to get a hold of if I had any questions so that was huge to me because there's a lot to do during this whole loan process and you want to know if everything's right. He provided as great a service as I could've wanted,PNB Housing Finance

06-11-2016,5,"Chaz was fantastic throughout the entire lending processs. I had my share of challenges with the original underwriter through no fault of Chase yet he stepped in quickly to rectify any issues I had. He was the glue that kept this deal together. I did have some challenges with my first property falling through and the last minute yet Chaz kept my spirits up and assisted through quickly transitioning to the new and much better property in the end. Again, cannot say enough positive things about Chaz. Consummate professional and very responsive. I would highly recommend doing business with him and plan on staying in touch for future opportunities",PNB Housing Finance
03-07-2016,5,Austen has been awsome in every step of the way with my refi and new home purchase. He explains your best options thoroughly with out any of the B.S other companies use to get your business . Being a repeat customer says it all.,PNB Housing Finance
07-10-2016,5,The salesperson kept pushing a cash out refi on me even when i told him I'm looking for a heloc specifically. Then he hangs up on me because I said I was quoted a better rate at TD bank. Ridiculous....,PNB Housing Finance
24-02-2017,1,"This was the worst experience ever. It was like they had never gone through the process before. I could not get a complete list of the documents required. Every other day it was a new request. The appraiser that they hired made so many mistakes I had to send in corrections and then during the underwriting process they had to go back and make more corrections. Wyndum would continue to ask for copies of documents over and over again. There were many documents that I had to send 3 and 4 times because they ""lost"" them or was not filed correctly, we went through 4 different people through the process. I would NEVER use them. Awful experience!",PNB Housing Finance
14-03-2016,1,"A good rate but a very frustrating process, constant delays, decisions made then changed, overwhelmed underwriting team with 3 week back log, rookie mistake related to Texas law that caused an additional 2 week wait. Closing happened almost 6 weeks after it should have. Courteous and professional, but not very knowledgeable and no sense of urgency. Would not recommend",PNB Housing Finance
13-08-2017,1,"They were not upfront. Learn from my mistake... I trusted the loan officer that my zero point rate is an option before closing the loan because he convinced me to initially sign the Good Faith Estimate with higher rate plus lender's credit. After running my numbers, the lower interest is favorable for me and asking for it now, I'm being charge points. It looks like they are only good in their words at the beginning so please be careful dealing with this lender",PNB Housing Finance
26-06-2016,1,"Initially, the Mortgage Broker was very friendly and assertive. Once the paper work was filled out and closing on the loan was eminent, it became increasingly difficult to reach the broker. I had to initiate all phone calls. It seemed as if I had to call to make the process move forward. It took four weeks to get a copy of my closing documents and the payoff for my credit card",PNB Housing Finance

Ours was a complicated process with a refinance and a loan and they hung in there with us the entire time. It was a great experience working with both of them. I highly recommend them and will use them in the future for all of my mortgage needs",PNB Housing Finance
11-10-2017,5,"Kory was by far the best loan officer I have ever worked with. We were dealing with a complicated refinance and purchase of two different properties and he was cool, calm, professional and extremely knowledgeable throughout the entire process. I wouldn’t use anyone else moving forward. His level of integrity and responsiveness is second to none. Thanks for everything, Kory",PNB Housing Finance
14-10-2016,5,"Expert loan officer, well versed in VA and the financial impacts of loan component changes. The best I have worked with across 7 home buying/selling deals. Now advocated for by the #1 real estate broker in the state due to his ability to close complicated and high pressure deals. She places him at the top of the list after 32 years in the business! Professionally and patiently answers detailed questions and can rally the expanded PNB Housing team (also stellar!) to support your needs. He handled my complicated VA loan that seemed to change every week while we tried to buy an Antebellum home (tough comps) during my retirement from the military (tough income verification) with five families all swapping homes (tons of contingencies). Everything along the way mattered and Aaron and the PNB Housing team got it done (even on weekends) and closed on time with the best interest rate in the market and no added origination fees. Look, do NOT pass up an opportunity to work with him. ",PNB Housing Finance
08-01-2016,5,"The PNB Housing team went above and beyond for me and my family and closed an important VA home loan on time despite many changes, my military retirement, and a very challenging Antebellum home that required the entire PNB Housing team to pull out all the stops, know the rules and regulations, and guide us through a tough VA process. I truly believe we would not have closed on time with a different team. I will only recommend PNB Housing for home loans...especially complicate VA loans",PNB Housing Finance
22-10-2016,3,"Dallas Goodlet and his entire team are deserving a special thank you. He was as professional as they come and closed our loan in 12 days. We were with another competitor originally and he called, saving us thousands over our current lender. It was a real pleasure getting to work with this institution and a class act like Dallas. Great job!",PNB Housing Finance
12-09-2017,3,"Comments: To begin my wife and I were at the point of signing completion with the leader of online home mortgage service. We were not satisfied with the origination cost so we applied to lending tree for competitive bids. Several lender matched or slightly beat PNB Housing but none were convincing at closing on time. We chose PNB Housing because of Dallas Goodlet believability on the closing. The sales, loan service and application process was competitive, assuring, professional, timely, supportive, and truthful. Dallas Goodlet/ Brent Custer and the whole PNB Housing team delivered the mortgage on time and at the price promised. We are completely satisfied and appreciative of the staff, product and service of your company. Kudos to all ",PNB Housing Finance
24-05-2017,3,"Working with Jon was such an amazing experience! From the start he offered answers to any questions I had since after all this was our first home purchase! Jon was always a phone call away ready to help where needed. He made the stringent home buying process as easy as possible! I would definitely recommend any potential buyers to work with Jon, I know for myself I will be calling him if we ever decide to buy another house! Thanks Jon",PNB Housing Finance
02-05-2017,5,PNB Housing was amazing to work with! The pre-approval process was easy and informational. We chose our home and closed within 30 days of our agreement date! Thanks PNB Housing for making our first home purchase an amazing experience!,PNB Housing Finance

10-02-2017,5,"I can't express how incredibly awesome our experience was with working with Bryant Small at PNB Housing. As a military family, we have purchased or refinanced many homes and this was by far the BEST experience we have ever had. Bryant makes it easy and took the time to discuss the best options for us. I've never met Bryant, but you can't mistake authenticity and we knew instantly he and PNB Housing were who we were going with. ",PNB Housing Finance
05-05-2016,5,Best loan officer I could have hoped for! Jeff exceeded my expectations. He worked very hard to get me the best rate possible. Highly recommended,PNB Housing Finance
18-07-2016,5,"Adam was great to work with during our refi! His attention to detail made this a smooth and easy transaction. It has been several years since we've gone thru the home loan process and we were unsure where to start. After talking with Adam, we were confident he was the one to help us with our refi.

He made the entire process easy and was very knowledgeable. The closing on this home was seamless, no surprises. I would definitely recommend Alex Madewell and PNB Housing to anyone looking for a mortgage.",PNB Housing Finance

05-05-2016,5,"Adam came highly recommended and from the first time we spoke with him, it was clear why. He was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and worked hard to ensure we were taken care of in all aspects. Beyond the necessary effective communication skills, he brought a personal touch after we closed by sending us a hand written note of congratulations. I will recommend him to everyone I know buying a house.",PNB Housing Finance
09-05-2017,1,"The closing process for a VA loan went smoothly. But the loan servicing by this so-called bank is a complete disaster. I set up our loan for automatic payments using their clunky website. Unlike other banks with which I do business, the PNB Housing website is not intuitive and does not provide confirmation for your entries. For the first 10 months, payments were automatically debited from my external account as scheduled. However, when the escrow amount changed, PNB Housing debited the old amount from my account and sent a deficiency letter for the balance -- unlike every other bank I have used in which the amount of the debit was automatically debited. PNB Housing sent me a ""credit counseling letter"" telling me that they did not apply any of the loan payment and would charge me a late payment over double the deficiency of $40 and change .... and suggested credit counseling services. When I called their servicing department, the representative told me the letter was sent in error and that everything had been adjusted so my account was showing that it was current. Two weeks later, I received a total of two voice mail messages and an e-mail in a span of 20 minutes from PNB Housing's default department. The woman with whom I first spoke was rude, said she showed no record of my earlier call, it was my problem, and then hung up on me. The second agent, a man in their default department, said that he did not show that I had made any automatic payments and that PNB Housing's system was not set up to adjust anything. After having over 25 years of mortgage payments with various banks, I have never experienced such incompetence and rude service. I specifically instructed the last agent to request that they sell servicing of our loan to another bank that is capable of actually performing customer service for a veteran ",PNB Housing Finance
13-08-2017,1,Miserable experience. They screwed up everything imaginable and never accepted responsibility for any of their errors. I wouldnt recommend them for the purchase of a doghouse much less purchasing a new home.,PNB Housing Finance
24-12-2017,2,"Our loan officer was happy to communicate before we committed. Once we committed he only communicated with us AFTER I questioned items and problems and AFTER I questioned why we weren't settling before our rate lock expired. We had no idea where we were in the process unless I contacted Steve. Poor, poor communication. Mr. Kang also was ""sure"" our house would appraise for $30k more than our house did, talking us into a loan that we didn't end up appraising for and then causing us to have to refinance at only .4% lower than our current mortgage. Our appraiser was disorganized and called twice for pictures he forgot. He used poor comps. We were contacted several times to look at documents that were expired before we could even sign on (within minutes of the email notifications). Only good was the actual settlement with a very sweet and competent notary (and thank goodness we were done). Poor process, poor communication - we will NEVER recommend PNB Housing and I have already told two people refinancing to steer clear. ",PNB Housing Finance
10-02-2017,1,"Started refinance with Nick things were going OK then there was a problem with a credit card fro 5 years earlier, which must of made the loan not possible. This I would of understood, But I never heard from them again? called Nick several times no response? I even called his supervisor no response? E-Mailed them no response? IS THIS THE COMPANY YOU WANT TO DUE BUSNESS...",PNB Housing Finance
20-05-2016,1,"This loan started off quite well. Our rep, Donna, was friendly and quick to respond to questions. She clearly explained how things would unfold, and it all sounded great. What I didn't count on was that the Bank never kept a single promise she made. I had the same problem with this Bank 15 or more times. I would ask for assurance about something, Donna would respond that things would be completed as I wished, and her promise was violated by the Bank EVERY SINGLE TIME. For example, in our first or second conversation, I explained to Donna that my wife would be traveling out of the country 11 weeks after beginning the loan process. Would it be a problem to get the loan closed before that? Not at all, she said. We should close several weeks before my wife's departure. 11 weeks later, the Bank was not ready to close. How did that happen? Donna would ask us to email documentation, which we would email back within 2-12 hours, depending on the occasion. Donna would then assure us that the documentation that we sent her was great, and the Bank had everything it needed. Then, weeks later, they would ask for additional documentation. This happened 5 or more times. Later in the process, they asked for repeats of earlier documentation because the earlier documentation that had I provided was now ""too old."" I cannot tell if this patterns recured because the Bank doesn't care about customers, or because it is just incompetent. Every time we complained about additional requests or some promise that wasn't kept, Donna told us that our complaints were justified and she was sorry. But she was unable or unwilling to rectify the broken promises. We finally closed 13 weeks or so after our initial application. I can only imagine how long the process would have taken if we had not responded to every request from the Bank on the day they made it, and if we hadn't pushed hard to get this deal done. This Bank treats customers with complete disrespect. As someone who has owned several properties in my life and has received more than 10 home mortgages from different banks, I can honestly say that this is the worst mortgage experience I've ever had. You owe it to yourself to work with another Bank that is more professional and more respectful of customers. If I could, I'd rate this Bank lower than one star",PNB Housing Finance

15-01-2016,2,"It all started when Bob G ran a credit check without my knowledge or consent. When I agreed to use PNB Housing, Bob told me that they could close in less than 4 weeks...it took 9. The day before closing they were still asking for paperwork. The day of closing (while my household goods were being unpacked) I was told a Power of Attorney could not be used. I had to fly to ID (where my wife was) take the docs to a notary and Fedex them back. I also had to get a bank check to send with the docs because they wouldn't accept a personal check. Then five days later (while driving from ID to NC) I had to coordinate having closing docs (which I already sent to them) from the sale of my other home sent to me so I could send to them.

12-09-2017,1,"Rep was extremely professional, friendly, and helpful when we first spoke. In fact, from my initial round of calls, I thought I was going to select him out of the five Lending Tree lenders (plus two banks I talked to directly). But then when I sent an email to all the lenders saying ""OK, the contract is signed. I want to select a lender and lock my rate TOMORROW, so please send me your best current rate and fees etc. with these EXACT loan parameters. It took the rep from PNB Housing over a week to respond. So I replied to him ""thanks but you are too late, I have selected someone else and already locked my rate."" Over the following few weeks I continued to receive emails from him saying ""when you are ready to proceed with your loan, let me know"". We CLOSED on January 8th, and on February 5th I got another such email. I guess he didn't really ever read my emails. I also told him on the phone that he had missed the boat, but that seemed to fall on deaf ears too.
